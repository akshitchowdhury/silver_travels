1. Silverline Tours & Travels organised our trip to the North East (Guwahati, Shillong, Cherrapunji & Kaziranga ) in Feb'2022. Planning and arrangements of hotels and car were very good. We enjoyed the trip thoroughly.

2. My wife and I took a trip to Andaman with Silverline Tours & Travels in October 2019. Every moment was fascinating. The arrangements, the hotels & hospitality was exclusively customized.
Even the evenings were made entertaining with in house fun and games. Still cherish the experience.

4. We have travelled with Silverline Tours & Travels since 2018 and covered multiple locations with them. Our first trip was to Kaziranga - Shillong. Second trip was to Kasauli - Chail and latest one was to Kashmir.
We had excellent experience in all three trips. The itinerary was customised to our needs. The cabs provided were in very good condition with cordial drivers. The hotels , rooms had nice views.Most important, Mrs Bose and her team was in touch throughout the trip and provided any help needed.
All in all, Silverline Tours & Travels has made all our holidays truly memorable and is highly recommended.

5. My wife and I along with 2 of our friends visited Kerala in Feb' 2024. Silverline Tours & Travels organised our trip. Everything was good. Nice rooms, excellent food, interesting visits. The Innova crysta car was comfortable and equipped with hand sanitizers, tissues and mineral water. Driver was excellent. Houseboat stay was relaxing with good food although the boat was surprisingly old and basic. Overall a good experience though there's scope for further improvements.
Cheers!
