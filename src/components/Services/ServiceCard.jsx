    text: `"My wife and I along with 2 of our friends visited Kerala in Feb' 2024. Silverline Tours & Travels organised our trip. Everything was good. Nice rooms, excellent food, interesting visits. The Innova crysta car was comfortable and equipped with hand sanitizers, tissues and mineral water. Driver was excellent. Houseboat stay was relaxing with good food although the boat was surprisingly old and basic. Overall a good experience though there's scope for further improvements.
    Cheers!
